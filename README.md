# The Problem
Customer retention and churn rates are important for businesses to have sustainable revenues, especially for e-commerce businesses. The retention rate of e-commerce is not as obvious as those businesses that rely on subscriptions. Subscription businesses can easily find those who unsubscribe, but e-commerce businesses only have sales reports with a large amount of transactions. This difference raises the questions: 
* How can the e-commerce business keep track of customer retention easily? 
* How can they create the customer segmentation of the business for improving the retention rate?
* Can they use MySQL and/or Power BI to automate these processes?

# The Goal
* Use SQL language to extract tables from the database to conduct cohort, trending, and RFM analysis.
* Connect Power BI to MySQL database and visualize the data analyses results on dashboards.
* Use the stored procedure function of MySQL and Power BI to automate the cohort and trending analyses.
* Use the Power Query Editor and DAX language in Power BI to automate RFM analysis.
* This project is for exploring the probability of MySQL and Power BI, so don't use Python!

# The data set
This project uses a Online Retail [Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
